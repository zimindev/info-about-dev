            <p> A hired employee in the IT sector is someone who works under a formal contract for a company or organization. They are typically part of a structured team and focus on specific roles such as software development, network administration, or cybersecurity. Hired employees benefit from job stability, regular income, and perks like health insurance, paid leave, and professional development opportunities. They often work on long-term projects and contribute to the organization's overall goals.</p>

            <p>A freelancer in the IT industry is an independent professional who offers services on a project-by-project basis. Freelancers have the flexibility to choose their clients, set their schedules, and work remotely. They often specialize in areas like web development, graphic design, or software engineering. While freelancing provides freedom and variety, it also comes with challenges such as irregular income, lack of employee benefits, and the need to manage their own business operations.</p>
